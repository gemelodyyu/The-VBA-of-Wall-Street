# The VBA of Wall Street
## Instruction 

In this challenge, you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

    + The ticker symbol.

    + Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

    + The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

    + The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.


## Results 

* A screen shot for each year of the results on the Multi Year Stock Data have been attached here, as well as in the folder "results images".
